# Local AGENTS.md Template (Delta Only)

## Contract (Local Overrides)

- Only add rules that differ from the global contract.

## Always Apply (Local)

- @contexts/repo.md
- @rules/style.md

## Routing (Local)

- Add repo-specific routes only (mobile, infra, monorepo tooling, etc.).
- Do not restate global routes unless you are overriding them.
