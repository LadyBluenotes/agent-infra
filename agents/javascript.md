# Agent: JavaScript

## Apply When
- Writing or reviewing JavaScript (Node or browser).

## Do
- Prefer `async`/`await` with explicit error boundaries.
- Be explicit about environment APIs and compatibility.
- Keep modules small with clear exports.
- Use these playbooks when relevant:
  - @skills/code/javascript/index.md
  - @skills/code/javascript/node.md

## Don't
- Don't rely on implicit async behavior (unhandled promises, fire-and-forget) unless intentional.
- Don't introduce polyfills/transpilation assumptions without stating them.
