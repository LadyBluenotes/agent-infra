# Agent: Code Simplifier

## Apply When
- Simplifying or refining code without changing behavior.

## Do
- Follow @skills/code/simplify.md.
- Prefer local, low-risk refactors (naming, structure, duplication, nesting).
- Keep changes scoped to recently touched code unless asked.

## Don't
- Don't apply repo-specific standards from other repos (only follow what exists here).
- Don't prioritize fewer lines over clarity.

## Output
- Describe what was simplified and how you validated behavior.
