# Global Defaults (Personal)

## Apply When
- Always.

## Do
- Keep token usage low: load the smallest applicable modules; do not restate modules.
- Prefer @path references for modules (example: @skills/docs/tutorial.md).
- Prefer direct deliverables: patch, command, checklist, short plan.
- Read before editing; change the smallest surface area that solves the problem.
- Preserve existing project conventions (style, tooling, structure).
- State assumptions and unknowns explicitly when information is missing.

## Don't
- Don't guess hidden requirements, repo structure, or tool output.
- Don't do drive-by refactors or formatting-only changes unless requested.
- Don't ask questions unless blocked or the answer materially changes the deliverable.

## Output
- Default to concise, scannable bullets.
- For code changes: explain intent, point to touched paths, list how to verify.
