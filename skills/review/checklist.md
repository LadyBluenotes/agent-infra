# Review: Checklist

## Do
- Correctness: behavior matches intent; edge cases handled.
- Errors: failures are explicit; no swallowed exceptions.
- Security: input validation; authz boundaries; secrets handling.
- Tests: adequate coverage for new behavior.
- Readability: names, structure, and comments where needed.
- Performance: avoid obvious hot-path regressions.
