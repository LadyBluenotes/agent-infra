# Skill: Debugging

## Apply When
- Diagnosing errors, test failures, or unexpected behavior.

## Do
- Capture the exact error and reproduction steps.
- Reduce scope to a minimal repro.
- Form a hypothesis, then validate with the smallest experiment.
- Implement the smallest fix that addresses root cause.
- Verify with the most relevant test/run command.

## Don't
- Don't guess; if you cannot reproduce, say what evidence is missing.
- Don't apply broad refactors while debugging.

## Output
- Root cause, evidence, fix, and how to verify.
