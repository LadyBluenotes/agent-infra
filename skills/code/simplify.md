# Simplify

## Apply When
- Simplifying or refining code without changing behavior.

## Do
- Keep behavior identical; prefer refactors that are easy to verify.
- Reduce nesting and incidental complexity.
- Improve naming and structure where it reduces mental load.
- Delete dead code and redundant abstractions when safe.

## Don't
- Don't change public APIs unless requested.
- Don't do repo-wide style churn.

## Output
- Describe what was simplified and how you verified no behavior change.
