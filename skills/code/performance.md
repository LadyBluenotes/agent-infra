# Performance

## Apply When
- Optimizing performance, scalability, or observability.
- Investigating latency, throughput, or resource bottlenecks.

## Do
- Establish a baseline with concrete metrics (latency, throughput, resource usage, Core Web Vitals).
- Identify bottlenecks with profiling, tracing, logs, or targeted benchmarks.
- Prioritize changes by user impact and effort; document hypotheses.
- Implement minimal, targeted optimizations; avoid broad refactors.
- Validate improvements with before/after measurements or load tests.
- Add monitoring, alerts, or budgets to prevent regressions.
- Document impact, tradeoffs, and follow-up work.

## Don't
- Don't optimize without measurements.
- Don't conflate synthetic benchmarks with user-perceived performance.
- Don't add caching without an invalidation plan.
- Don't claim improvements without data.
