# Skill: Code

## Apply When
- Implementing features, fixes, refactors, automation, or tooling.

## Do
- Use the smallest workflow module that fits:
  - Implement/change: @skills/code/implement.md
  - Validate (tests/build): @skills/code/validate.md
  - Communicate results: @skills/code/communicate.md

## Don't
- Don't broaden the scope (refactors, dependency bumps) unless requested.

## Output
- Include touched paths and verification commands.
