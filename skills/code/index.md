# Code

## Apply When
- Implementing features, fixes, refactors, automation, or tooling.

## Do
- Use the smallest workflow module that fits:
  - Implement/change: @skills/code/implement.md
  - JavaScript deep dives: @skills/code/javascript/index.md
  - SolidJS deep dives: @skills/code/solid/index.md
  - TypeScript deep dives: @skills/code/typescript/index.md
  - Performance work: @skills/code/performance.md
  - Validate (tests/build): @skills/code/validate.md
  - Communicate results: @skills/code/communicate.md

## Playbooks
- Implement: @skills/code/implement.md (making or refactoring code changes)
- Validate: @skills/code/validate.md (tests/build/typecheck after changes)
- Communicate: @skills/code/communicate.md (reporting what changed and how to verify)
- Simplify: @skills/code/simplify.md (readability-only refactors without behavior changes)
- Performance: @skills/code/performance.md (targeted optimization with measurement)
- Accessibility: @skills/code/accessibility.md (UI/UX accessibility checks)
- JavaScript: @skills/code/javascript/index.md (JS runtime patterns and module usage)
- TypeScript: @skills/code/typescript/index.md (type modeling, config, TS-specific fixes)
- SolidJS: @skills/code/solid/index.md (Solid-specific patterns and primitives)

## Don't
- Don't broaden the scope (refactors, dependency bumps) unless requested.

## Output
- Include touched paths and verification commands.
