# Code: TypeScript

## Apply When
- Working in `.ts`, `.tsx`, or `.d.ts` files.
- Configuring `tsconfig.json` or build tooling for TypeScript.
- Fixing or preventing TypeScript errors (TS2322, TS2339, "is not assignable to").
- Optimizing TypeScript compilation or type system performance.

## Do
- Apply the curated TypeScript guidance when it is relevant: @skills/code/typescript/curated.md.
- Prioritize correctness and clarity over clever type tricks.
- Measure compile time or typecheck performance before and after optimizations.
- Keep type changes localized and explicit; avoid sweeping type refactors unless requested.

## Don't
- Don't apply TypeScript performance rules to non-TypeScript work.
- Don't introduce complex types without clear benefit.
- Don't claim performance improvements without data.

## Output
- Call out any TypeScript-specific tradeoffs and risks.
- Include relevant configuration or type changes with paths.
